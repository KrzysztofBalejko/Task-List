# Task-List

This little app allows user to:

* Add/remove tasks to the list.

* Data is stored in a local storage which simply means that items will stay listed even if the site is reloaded.

* Items will be removed from the storage once cleared or by clicking on [X].


**Language: native JavaScript (no JQuery)**

**Frameworks: Materialize CSS, BootstrapCDN for Font Awesome**


## Getting started

`git clone https://github.com/KrzysztofBalejko/Task-List.git`

 Simply open index.html file in your browser

 I recommend using Chrome instead of IE.
